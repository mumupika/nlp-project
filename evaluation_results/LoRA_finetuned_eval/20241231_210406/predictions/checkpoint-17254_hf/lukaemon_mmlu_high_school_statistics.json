To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory.

At first, she had decided to use a random sample of 15 observations. But her teacher asked her to take 35 observations. The mean and standard deviation from 35 observations turned out to be approximately the same as those from 15 observations. Is there any advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15 observations?\nA. There is no advantage. Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations.\nB. There is no advantage. In fact, the 20 extra observations will increase the likelihood of error.\nC. There is no advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be wider than that using 15 observations.\nD. There is some advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be narrower than that using 15 observations.\nAnswer: D",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC.

By the law of large numbers, the next toss is more likely to be an odd number than another even number.\nB. Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\nC. Dice actually do have memories, and thus the number that comes up on the next toss will be influenced by the previous tosses.\nD. The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\nAnswer: D",

He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\nA. Because tis more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nD.

Yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school.\nC. Yes, because the 24 out of every 25 students who are not selected will form a control group.\nD. No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\nAnswer: A",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove.

Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office, and 14 engineers work in the New Orleans office. The business manager decided to use a 2-sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices. Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?\nA. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.\nB. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.\nC. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.\nD. No, because the entire population information was used from both offices. Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.\nAnswer: C",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory.

To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory.

When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30. Which statement follows from this correlation?\nA. If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\nB. If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\nC. Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\nAnswer: D",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams.
