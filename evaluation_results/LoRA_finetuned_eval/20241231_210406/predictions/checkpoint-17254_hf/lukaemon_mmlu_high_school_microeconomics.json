At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nC. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nD. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.\nAnswer: D",
