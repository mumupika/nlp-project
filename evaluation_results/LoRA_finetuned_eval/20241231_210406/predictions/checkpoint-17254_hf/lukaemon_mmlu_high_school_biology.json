Which of the following statements correctly explains how this is an advantage for lungfish?\nA. Urea is insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom of the small pools. Thus the poisonous substance is isolated from the fish.\nB. Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools.\nC. Other fish in the small pools can use urea as an energy source.\nD. The highly toxic urea makes the pool uninhabitable to competitors.\nAnswer: D",
