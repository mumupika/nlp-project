The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove.

In surveying 50 basketball players, it is noted that the 25 who claim to study the most hours have a higher point average than the 25 who study less. Based on this study, the coach begins requiring the players to spend more time studying. Which of the following is a correct statement?\nA. While this study may have its faults, it still does prove causation.\nB. There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.\nC. While this is a controlled experiment, the conclusion of the coach is not justified.\nD. To get the athletes to study more, it would be more meaningful to have them put in more practice time on the court to boost their point averages, as higher point averages seem to be associated with more study time.\nAnswer: D",

Which of the following conclusions is correct?\nA. Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\nB. The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.\nC. Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\nD. A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\nAnswer: D",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove.

By the law of large numbers, the next toss is more likely to be an odd number than another even number.\nB. Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\nC. Dice actually do have memories, and thus the number that comes up on the next toss will be influenced by the previous tosses.\nD. The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\nAnswer: D",

He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\nA. Because tis more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory.

It is known that the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures. Which of the following is an appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation, and why?\nA.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams.

When done correctly, a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample.\nB. When done correctly, a stratified random sampling process has less variability from sample to sample than a simple random sample.\nC. When done correctly, a stratified random sample can provide, with a smaller sample size, an estimate that is just as reliable as that of a simple random sample with a larger sample size.\nD. A stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.\nAnswer: D",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove.
