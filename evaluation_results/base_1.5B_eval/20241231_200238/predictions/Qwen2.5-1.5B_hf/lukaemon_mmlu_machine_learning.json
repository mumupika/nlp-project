It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.\nAnswer: C\n\nStatement 1| The derivative of the sigmoid $\\sigma(x)=(1+e^{-x})^{-1}$ with respect to $x$ is equal to $\\text{Var}(B)$ where $B\\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))$ is a Bernoulli random variable. Statement 2| Setting the bias parameters in each layer of neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\nAnswer: D",
