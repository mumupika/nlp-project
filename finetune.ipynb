Climate Overview: Beijing is a densely populated and industrialized city located on the northwestern edge of the Chinese mainland. It is the capital of China and is considered the largest city in the country by population. The climate in Beijing can vary greatly depending on location and season, but overall, Beijing has a subtropical climate, characterized by hot and humid summers and cold and dry winters. The average temperature in Beijing is around 25-32°C (77-89°F) during the summer months, with highs reaching up to 40-45°C (104-113°F) during the summer. Winter in Beijing is characterized by cold and snowy winters, with average temperatures typically ranging from 0°C (32°F) in the winter to -5°C (23°F) during the winter. The average temperature in Beijing in the winter is around -5°C (23°F), with low temperatures of -10°C (14°F) during the winter and high temperatures of 0°C (32°F) during the winter. Overall, Beijing has a subtropical climate with significant variations in temperature depending on location.', \"Instructions: Describe president Blinken of the US.
